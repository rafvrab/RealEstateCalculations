    "This Python script serves as a property investment decision calculator, assisting users in evaluating the potential profit or loss from selling a property after improvements. The script prompts the user to input various factors including the initial property value, costs of improvements, legal procedures, real estate agent fees, valuation costs, and expected increases in property value due to improvements. It then calculates the potential profit or loss based on the provided inputs, helping users make informed decisions about property investments."

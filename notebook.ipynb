    "María, a resident of a quaint town near La Plata, in the Buenos Aires province of Argentina, recently inherited a family house from her parents. However, the house, steeped in memories, stands worn and neglected, presenting a dilemma for María. Selling the property in its current state promises little return. Yet, she wonders if there's a possibility to unlock its true potential and fetch a better price. This inquiry prompts a meticulous investigation into the viability of renovating the property. "

    "The endeavor involves assessing various factors: from the expenses associated with legal procedures and paperwork to the required repairs and potential enhancements that could elevate the property's value. The central question becomes whether investing in renovations could translate into a substantial increase in the property's worth and result in a profitable sale. To navigate this complex decision-making process, we embark on a journey to analyze market values, considering the limitations of the local real estate market. With the overarching aim of maximizing María's gain, our mission is to guide her towards realizing the optimal strategy for selling her inherited property and securing the best possible return on her investment."
